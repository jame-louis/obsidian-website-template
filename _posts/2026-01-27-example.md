# My First Post

This is content written in Obsidian that will be published with Jekyll.

You can use all standard Markdown features here.

## Tips for this workflow

- Name files like `2026-01-27-my-post-title.md` in `_posts/`
- Always include the YAML front matter
- Images go in `assets/images/` and reference with `/assets/images/photo.jpg`
- Push to GitHub and Actions will automatically build and deploy
