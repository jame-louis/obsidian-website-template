## Key Concepts

### Concept 1: Foundation Building
All learning starts with a solid foundation. Before diving into complex topics, we need to understand the fundamentals. This course is designed to give you that foundation.

**Key Points:**
- Fundamentals matter
- Don't skip the basics
- Ask questions when confused

### Concept 2: Hands-On Learning
Reading about a topic is different from doing it. You'll learn by working with tools and writing code throughout this course.

**Best Practices:**
- Follow along with examples
- Type code (don't copy-paste)
- Experiment and break things

### Concept 3: Community and Support
Learning is easier with others. Use office hours, form study groups, and help your peers.

**Resources:**
- Office hours twice per week
- Study groups encouraged
- Online discussion forum

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Download Required Tools
Visit the [Resources]({{ site.baseurl }}/pages/resources) page for download links and installation instructions for:
- Development environment
- Required libraries and frameworks
- Code editor/IDE

### Step 2: Install and Configure
Follow the installation guide provided in the Resources section. Allow 1-2 hours for this process.

**Verification:** You should be able to create and run a basic "Hello World" project.

### Step 3: Create Your First Project
1. Open your development environment
2. Create a new project
3. Give it a meaningful name
4. Run the default example
5. Make a small modification and run it again

### Step 4: Get Familiar with Tools
- Explore your IDE/editor
- Find the run button
- Locate the output/console area
- Try creating a simple change

## Code Examples

### Basic Template
```
Here's how you'll structure your projects:

Project structure:
- Configuration files
- Source code directory
- Output/build directory
- Tests directory
```

### Common Pattern
```
A typical workflow:
1. Create project
2. Add code
3. Build/compile
4. Run/test
5. Debug if needed
```

## Practice Exercises
